The above project is a part of the assignment given in the fourth semester of my engineering course.
The project is built in php 5.6.40 and makes use of Apache 2.0 handler api. Besides this it also employs the use of html, css and bootstrap. The project is built in Linux environment on XAMPP.

Usage: 
* Install a suitable XAMPP version. I used :
  PHP 7.0.30-0ubuntu0.16.04.1 (cli) ( NTS )
  Copyright (c) 1997-2017 The PHP Group
  Zend Engine v3.0.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2017 Zend Technologies with Zend OPcache v7.0.30-0ubuntu0.16.04.1, Copyright (c) 1999-   2017, by Zend Technologies.
* Clone the repository in htdocs folder. In linux the address for copying is /opt/lampp/htdocs/. Copy files as superuser.
* Next create a folder called uploads in htdocs or wherever you copied the repo. For linux the command is "sudo mkdir uploads"   without the quotes.
* Next start Xampp. For windows just double click and for linux users open terminal and type "sudo /opt/lampp/lampp start"       without the quotes.
* Next open your browser and in the address bar type "localhost" or "127.0.0.1" without the quotes.
* If in linux some error occurs while connecting to database try to execute the following command in terminal without the         quotes "sudo chmod -R 755 /opt/lampp/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php"
